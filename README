INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

First, you will need the Ministro app from BogDan/KDE, if you haven't already. You can find it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.necessitas.ministro&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5rZGUubmVjZXNzaXRhcy5taW5pc3RybyJd). It's free.

Then, download and install the APK from the release/ directory (there is not a stable build yet, so there is no release/ directory.

If you have not installed Ministro before, or if it can't find certain libraries (the files Monarq uses to run), the app will ask to install additional libraries. Do so.

Once you've done that, you should be good to go!
